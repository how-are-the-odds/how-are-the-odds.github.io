  "A data-driven study of segregation in New York schools.";

It's frequently said that systemic school segregation is particularly bad in New
York schools, and a quick search seems to confirm that information. For
instance,
[this report](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/nyc-school-segregation-report-card-still-last-action-needed-now/NYC_6-09-final-for-post.pdf "UCLA report on NY Segregation")
from the
[UCLA Civil Rights Project](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/ "UCLA Civil Rights Project Website")
argues that New York is the worst state in the nation when it comes to
segregation of Black students and the second worse when it comes to Latino
students. I am going to look at the data
[here](https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php), to see if,

1. I can reproduce their conclusions,
2. Their conclusions need updating in the time since 2018 (the last available
   data for that study),
3. I can make any informative graphics that are not already present in their
   (very thorough) study.

### The data (just some technical points)

There's a pretty rich supply of data on the website, so to get started, I'm
going to look at the enrollment database for 2021-2022 (so only one year out of
the data), since there is more rich accompanying data for that year (like
graduation rates, which I suspect they have yet to collect for 2023).

The two files in the resulting zip are `.accdb` and `.mdb`, which I hope/suspect
have the same content, since I don't want to do too much work reading them.
Since they are both Microsoft Access files, and I'm on a Linux machine, I am
going to need to do some work getting them read. After some looking around at
options (probably took ~30 minutes total), I settled on using
[mdbtools](https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools) to read out the info.

Instead of messing around with `mdbtools`'s lightweight version of `SQL`, I
decided to just export each of the tables to a `.csv` that I can read in with
`pandas` to save me from having to deal with too many languages in my pipeline.
If I end up needing to process the data for many different years, I can do the
exporting with a Bash script.

### First steps

To start, I want to get a sense of working with the data. There is a formula for
the amount of diversity reflected in a school's makeup in
[the report](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/nyc-school-segregation-report-card-still-last-action-needed-now/NYC_6-09-final-for-post.pdf "UCLA report on NY Segregation")
on page 92 (the last page). The quantity measures the amount of exposure of one
demographic group to another demographic group. In particular, it is the
quantity given by the hypothetical:

> Given a randomly selected member of demographic group $A$ in the district.
> What is the probability that if they randomly select a classmate, that
> classmate will belong to demographic group $B$?

```math
E_{AB} = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \mathcal{A}} \left[ \mathbb{P}_{s \sim \mathcal{S}(a)} \left( s \in B \right) \right] = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{i} a_i \cdot \frac{b_i}{t_i}
```

In the first expression, $\mathcal{A}$ is the distribution over schools
determined by demographic group $A$, $\mathcal{S}$ is the probability over
students in a school, and $\mathcal{S}(s)$ is the school determined by student
$s$. In the second expression, $A$ is the number of students belonging to
demographic group $A$ in a larger district, $a_i$ is the number of students in
school $i$ of demographic group $A$, and $t_i$ is the total number of students
in school $i$.

For a given larger unit (such as a county), we may summarize exposure rates in a
matrix $E$ whose entries are given by the exposure rates $E_{AB}$. Each row,
$E_A$ then corresponds to the class composition of a the typical student of
demographic group $A$.

I focused mostly on the New York City area because it has a much more diverse
student body than the rest of the state, but I also took a look at Onondaga,
since that's the county I currently live in. Here's a plot of the non-White
student population in New York State by county, just as confirmation:

I generated some of the exposure matrices and plotted them below. Most of the
matrices are for the county level. The only two matrices that are not generated
from aggregation on the county level are "NYC", which aggregates all boroughs
together, and "NY STATE", which aggregates at the state level.

### Further analysis

How should we interpret these matrices? Well, if a student's race doesn't affect
which school they get sorted into, then we would expect each _row_ of a given
matrix to be the same. Thus, the more vertical stripy-ness we see in the matrix,
the better! We could even measure this quantity numerically.

I see two main ways to do it. My first thought was to consider the _rank_ of the
resulting matrix, since if all the rows of the matrix are equal, then the rank
would be zero. Of course, we would want to avoid measuring the rank directly,
since these matrices are sufficiently generic that they should be full rank.
Thus, we want a more stable approximation of the rank. A classic example is the
nuclear norm, which forms a convex envelope of rank when $\| E \|_{2} \le 1$.
However, the math here is already getting far too complicated for the use case,
and I suspect that this approach will lack any clear interpretability.

However, here's a second idea that I think will serve the problem better. Since
the demographic groups that I'm using sum to one, and my major concern is
understanding the differences of scholastic experience of students from
different demographic backgrounds, we can treat each row as a vector. We can
then cluster or plot the PCA of these vectors to get a sense of student
experience. However, PCA'ing these will give inconsistent choices of axes
between different counties, so I won't be able to compare that well. I also
tried grouping them together into one big data set. However, this approach picks
up the overall demographic differences in the county "too much" and is
distracted by the overall baseline rates, which vary a lot, county-to-county.

How do we solve this? Well, the matrices I generated care a lot about the
overall demographic makeup of the county. This is good to have for an expression
for the lived experience of the "average", student, but when discussing school
segregation, it is helpful to consider the segregation _relative to_ what one
would expect if there was no segregation at all, which will still have uneven
numbers of students of various demographic groups. That is, there is a baseline
amount of exposure to a given demographic group that one would expect if all
schools in a county were exactly representative of the overall demographic
makeup. To do this, we will divide each column by the expected proportion of the
overall demographic makeup expected for that group. This gives us these
matrices:

<img src={normalizedExposureMatrix} className="med" alt="." />

I was surprised to see that these matrices are symmetric! It certainly wasn't
obvious to me that they should be, but examining the formula makes it clear:

```math
\tilde{E}_{AB} = \frac{T}{B} E_{AB} = \frac{T}{AB} \sum_{i} \frac{a_i b_i}{t_i} = \frac{T}{A} E_{BA} = \tilde{E}_{BA}
```

We can understand this quantity as how many more or fewer classmates one has of
a given group than expected in an unsegregated system. For instance, if
$\tilde{E}_{AB} = 2.0$, that means that a student belonging to group $A$
encounters twice as many students of group $B$ as they would if the system was
unsegregated. In other words, $\tilde{E}_{AB}$ is the amount more representation
of group $B$ that group $A$ experiences than expected. So the result means that,

> On average, members of a group $A$ experience members of group $B$ as the same
> amount _(over/under)-represented_ as members of group $B$ experience members
> of group $B$ as (over/under)-represented.

For this intuitive reason, I will refer to the quantity $\tilde{E}_{AB}$ as the
representation between $A$ and $B$. In a system without any partitioning of
students, this quantity would always be one.

In the plot above, we can see a lot of grouping. Values in red correspond to
over-representation while values in blue correspond to under-representation. So,
for instance, in Westchester County, we see that students that are White, Asian,
and Multiracial experience overrepresentations of each other, while Black,
American Indian, and Hispanic students experience over representations of each
other. Between these two demographic "blocks", there is generally
under-representation. Perhaps more striking in Westchester county is that Black
students are over-represented to other Black students by a factor of three,
while White and Black students see each other at 42% of the expected rate.

There are limitations to this readout. I am trying hard not to take a
moral/ethical stance, since it may be the case that "segregation" is helpful for
students in certain contexts. For instance, in Onondaga county, the
representation score for American Indians with each other is larger than twenty.
In a vacuum, this means that American Indians see twenty times as much of each
other as they would if the county had one big school. However, the alternative
seems worse. In reality, only one fourth of the average American Indian
student's class is American Indian (see the first set of matrices). In the
"unsegregated" situation, only about 1% of an American Indian's class would be
of the same demographic background. This honestly seems worse! In that scenario,
every classmate of an American Indian student would have a different demographic
background. So, particularly when the overall number of students from a
demographic group is small, the representation stats might not be the most
helpful tool.

That said, we can plot a three-dimensional PCA of these matrices to plot the
experiences of representaiton of each demographic group. The key thing is the
plot should be taken with a grain of salt.
