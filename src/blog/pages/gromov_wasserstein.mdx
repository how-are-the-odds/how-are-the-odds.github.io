  "Discussion of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance in preparation for a presentation at the AMS Southeast Spring Sectional Meeting.";

I'm going to be delivering a talk in March at the
[AMS Southeast Spring Sectional Meeting](http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2313_program_ss12.html#title)
in Tallahassee during the special session on Geometry and Symmetry in Data
Science. [Ranthony Edmonds](http://www.ranthonyclark.com/) and I will be talking
in series about a monstrosity of a paper we contributed to:
[The Gromov Wasserstein Distance between Spheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10586).
This paper was an absurd amount of work to write up and trim down--there are
many smaller results we decided to omit, which I think everyone involved in the
paper may have forgotten (I certainly have).

This is a convenient topic, since a portion of my thesis features my work on the
paper, and so I am happy to have the opportunity to think about it for double
reasons. I'm also hoping to use the excuse to make some graphics for
understanding our results better.

Ranthony will be speaking about the front half of the paper, which features a
variety of lower bounds, and I will follow up with the exact computation of the
Gromov Wasserstein distance in a particular case (we formulate the space of
Gromov Wasserstein distances by parameters $p$ and $q$ and we find the exact
computation only for $p=4$, $q=2$ and when the spaces are spheres).

## The Gromov Wasserstein Family

In the paper, we formulate a family of Gromov Wasserstein distances between
metric measure spaces:

```math
\operatorname{GW}_{p, q}(X, Y) := \inf_{\gamma \in \mathcal{C}(X, Y)} \left[ \int_{X\times Y} \int_{X\times Y} \left( d_X^q(x, x') - d_Y^q(y, y') \right)^{p / q} \ d\gamma(x, y) \ d\gamma(x', y') \right]^{1/p}
```

Oh boy! What a disgusting expression. But alas we are stuck with it if we want
the flexibility of the Gromov Wasserstein distance. If you are not familiar with
the GW distance, the basic idea is to match up points in two spaces ($X$ and
$Y$) such that points in $X$ that are given distance apart correspond to points
in the space $Y$ that are a similar distance apart. The way one elects to punish
the discrepancy is given by the parameters $p$ and $q$. Extremal choices of $p$
and $q$ (i.e. $0$ and $\infty$) correspond to other distances between metric
measure spaces that I am less familiar with.

## In Practice

Solving the non-convex infimization problem at the heart of Gromov Wasserstein
is a form of
[Quadratic Assignment Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_assignment_problem),
which is
[NP-Hard](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/scetbon22b/scetbon22b.pdf). In
practice, solutions are pursued through either a low rank approach or via
entropic regularization (or both). Relevantly, the form of the Gromov
Wasserstein distance used in practice by default does not align with the
[distance first introduced by Memoli](https://media.adelaide.edu.au/acvt/Publications/2011/2011-Gromov%E2%80%93Wasserstein%20Distances%20and%20the%20Metric%20Approach%20to%20Object%20Matching.pdf),
but rather packages like [OTT](https://ott-jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) use
the $(p, q) = (4, 2)$ distance by default.

This is convenient for two reasons:

1. It justifies our study of this broader family.
2. This case interacts very pleasantly with the metric if both $X$ and $Y$ are
   Hilbert spaces, which helps us from a proof perspective.

## The Key Move

I'll narrow down to point (b.). If the distances are both given by the norm of
an inner product space and the points sit on a sphere, then the optimization
problem can be rewritten as (see our paper for details, the quantity in question
is $J(\gamma)$):

```math
\operatorname{GW}_{4, 2}(X, Y) \sim \sup_{\gamma \in \mathcal{C}(X, Y)} \int_{X \times Y}\int_{X \times Y} \langle x, x' \rangle \langle y, y' \rangle \ d\gamma(x, y) \ d\gamma(x', y')
```

I'm abstractly interested in ways to do this same sort of move in cases when one
is not restricted to the sphere, but I haven't been able to suss anything out
without requiring the points to be on the sphere in some fashion. The key
feature of this move is the following trace-cycling move:

```math
\langle x, x' \rangle \langle y, y' \rangle = x^t x' (y'^t) x' = \operatorname{Tr}[x^t x' (y'^t) y] = \operatorname{Tr}[yx^t (y'(x')^t)^t].
```

The trace can then be pulled out of the double integral by linearity to get
(after subsequent simplifications),

```math
\sup_{\gamma \in \mathcal{C}(X, Y)} \int_{X \times Y}\int_{X \times Y} \langle x, x' \rangle \langle y, y' \rangle \ d\gamma(x, y) \ d\gamma(x', y') =
\sup_{\gamma \in \mathcal{C}(X, Y)} \left\| \int_{X \times Y} x y^t \ d\gamma(x, y) \right\|_F^2

```

However, currently this trick seems quite dependent on the points being on the
sphere. With this new objective, we can proceed with a rather technical argument
to show that the optimal value between two spheres is achieved via an
"equatorial map".

## Visualizing the Equatorial Map

This map consists of projecting the larger sphere down to the smaller dimension
orthogonally, and then rescaling the points to lie on the sphere. Here's what
the coupling looks like between a sphere and a circle:

<img className="small" src={equatorialMap} />

This is a risky plot to make, since it implies that the two spheres live in the
same space while the fundamental value of the Gromov Wasserstein distance is
that it does not require the two metric measure spaces to live in the same
ambient space. In preparation for the talk, I've tried to make illustrations
that better capture this idea.

I used [OTT](https://ott-jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)'s entropic Gromov
Wasserstein solver to explicitly find a coupling between a sphere and a circle.
Next, we light up points on the circle and simultaneously light up their
counterparts on the sphere. Note that the particular correspondence does not
match up to the illustration above, since there are a variety of valid
"equators" to select within the sphere. Hopefully in this picture it is clear
that the two spaces are distinct.

However, this is a plot of "sections", and it might be valuable to see more
viscerally where each point in the sphere is going. Since the optimal coupling
happens to be achievable through an actual map, we can illustrate the process of
moving points according to the coupling.

<img className="med" src={couplingAnim4} />

I have tried to shift the points over while matching to emphasize that the two
spaces are distinct, but I think that it might be fundamentally distracting.
Here's what it looks like without the shifting. We color points close to use
red, and points far away blue

There's still a twist due to the rotation-ambiguity of the optimal coupling.

## Future Directions

### Altering $p$ and $q$

My main concern is how changing $p$ and $q$ changes the optimal coupling. It
appears that there might be some dependence of the coupling on $p$ and $q$, and
its certainly unclear what the best coupling is in these cases. I haven't been
able to suss out what the optimal couplings are in any other cases.

For instance, when $(p, q) = (2, 1)$, the coupling looks like it might be
equatorial, but I'm not sure.

<img className="med" src={couplingAnim11} />

However, changing to $(8, 4)$ seems to yield a different coupling (not that I
can identify what it is either!):

### Altering the spaces

A disappointing feature of the case of spheres is the symmetry built into the
geometry. The local distribution of distances (i.e. the density of distances
from a given point to every other point in the sphere) at any point in the
sphere is always the same. This allows the ambiguity of many possible equatorial
couplings as well. I'd be particularly interested in finding spaces where the
local distributions of distances differ from the global distribution (i.e. the
local distributions averaged over all points). This would induce a gap in the
third and second lower bounds, and give a better framework for how tight the
third lower bound is in specific cases.
