## A Mathematical Perspective on Transformers

I've been reading the paper
[A Mathematical Perspective on Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10794.pdf "A Mathematical Perspective on Transformers")
for my advisor's reading group, and I thought I'd talk about my thoughts here. I
would not typically read a paper like this (it involves a lot of PDEs and the
like, whose pathology I tend to avoid), but I saw it linked in multiple
contexts, so it seems like I have little choice in the long run about whether
I'm going to read it.
